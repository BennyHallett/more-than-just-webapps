## Touch Points

* Intro, difference between Ruby and Rails
  * rails is great for a small group of people getting a webapp up and running
    fast but its not the only thing Ruby is good for
* General scripting language (prefer it over bash)
  * Simple Example bash vs Ruby
* Powerful command line apps (taking the above further)
  * Options Parser
  * Trollop
  * GLI
  * Thor
  * Piping using ARGF
  * use all your favourite gems
  * Our approach at work: library with thin CLI wrapper
  * Deployment via gem
* Games using that games framework
  * Make a simple game (breakout, doesn't need to be polished)
  * Show some code
  * Deployment via gem
* If you want to Webapp, there's more frameworks
  * Juri's comment: Not a lot of people use frameworks other than Rails, it's
    the default choice
  * Lotus - lot of traction lately
  * Padrino
  * Sinatra - http microframework
  * Volt
